# Full_stack_IMDB
I have implemented full pipeline of datascience from scrapping data from web to implementing ml and NLP classification

Phase I:

Here I have scraped data from IMDB website  (imdb.py) 

Phase II:

I have tried to implement simple ML regression on the data (ml_imdb.py)

Phase III:

I have prepared the data for NLP classification (multilabel_prep.py)

Phase IV:

I have implemented multilabel NLP classifier using various techniques like chain classifier etc.
